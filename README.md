Prince Edward Island Schools Map
================================

I went looking for a map of schools on Prince Edward Island (at http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/ for example) and couldn't find one, so I decided to hack one together myself.

The source information is the [Department of Education and Early Childhood Development's School Finder](http://www.edu.pe.ca/finder/schoolfinderresults.asp?searchtype=all) which contains (somewhat inaccurate and poorly-formatted) civic address data.

I scraped this data, did some manual clean-up, and then matched each address against [Prince Edward Island Civic Address data](http://wiki.ruk.ca/wiki/Downloading_PEI_Civic_Address_Data).

The map is likely still somewhat inaccurate due to issues with the original data source; please email corrections to me as you find problems and I will update.
